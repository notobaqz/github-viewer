# github viewer

A Python script using **Playwright (Chromium)** and **asyncio** to simulate human-like visits to GitHub profiles concurrently.  
It randomly rotates user agents, blocks unnecessary resources, and mimics mouse movements to resemble real browser activity.

## feat

- Launches multiple concurrent Chromium browser contexts  
- Randomizes user agents for each visit  
- Blocks images, fonts, and stylesheets to speed up loading  
- Simulates realistic mouse movements and delays  
- Fully asynchronous and efficient with concurrency control

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+  
- [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/python/)  

## Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the script:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/notobaqz/github-viewer.git
